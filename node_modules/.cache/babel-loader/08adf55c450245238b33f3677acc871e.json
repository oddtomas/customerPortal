To imitate non-atomic announcements simply use\n  multiple live regions:\n  <>\n    <LiveRegion>{title}</LiveRegion>\n    <LiveRegion><Details /></LiveRegion>\n  </>\n*/\n\nexport default memo(LiveRegion);\n\nfunction LiveRegion(_a) {\n  var _b = _a.assertive,\n      assertive = _b === void 0 ? false : _b,\n      _c = _a.delay,\n      delay = _c === void 0 ? 10 : _c,\n      children = _a.children;\n  var sourceRef = useRef(null);\n  var targetRef = useRef(null);\n  /*\n    When React state changes, React often produces too many DOM updates, causing NVDA to\n    issue many announcements for the same logical event (See https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/issues/7996).\n       The code below imitates a debouncing, scheduling a callback every time new React state\n    update is detected. When a callback resolves, it copies content from a muted element\n    to the live region, which is recognized by screen readers as an update.\n       If the use case requires no announcement to be ignored, use delay = 0, but ensure it\n    does not impact the performance.
